//TODO: Final name for the rules
These are the RoboCup Junior Soccer Entry rules for the *1:1 Open League*,
proposed for the super-region of Europe for the 2023 season. They are
released by the RoboCupJunior Soccer Community in coordination with the European RoboCupJunior Regional
Representatives. The English version of these rules has priority over any translations.

The aim of this document is to provide an entry-level rule set for RCJ Soccer that is harmonized across countries in
Europe and that may be referenced at European local and super-regional tournaments, as well as beyond Europe if needed.
However, some sub-regions may have their own version of Soccer Entry rules. Teams are advised to check with their Local
Organizing Committee and Regional Representative regarding updates and changes to this rule set specific to their
location. Each team is responsible for verifying the correct and latest version of the rules prior to competition.

//IMPORTANT: *NOTE:* This is an early and unrevised draft of these rules. Do not share or redistribute!

IMPORTANT: *NOTE*: This is a draft version of these rules, subject to change.

NOTE: *NOTE*: This ruleset is not intended to be used at international level, except for super-regional
tournaments in Europe.

//NOTE: These are the Draft rules. Although they are still subject to change, the
//TC expects the changes to be minimal and at mostly cosmetic.

== Preface

In the RoboCupJunior Soccer Entry challenge, teams of young engineers design, build,
and program {++one++} fully autonomous mobile robot to compete against another team
in matches. The robots must detect a ball and score into a color-coded goal on
a special field that resembles a human soccer field.

To be successful, participants must demonstrate skill in programming, robotics,
electronics and mechatronics. Teams are also expected to contribute to the
advancement of the community as a whole by sharing their discoveries with other
participants and by engaging in good sportsmanship, regardless of culture, age
or result in the competition. *All are expected to compete, learn, have fun, and grow.*

RoboCupJunior Soccer Entry contains rules for one entry-level league. They are based on
the international rulesets. Their main differences compared to those are:

* *The Field* is based on the international field, but without the outer area which
reduces the complexity of robot construction and gameplay.

* *The Ball* The league uses the same special ball that emits an IR signal that Light Weight League uses. Please see <<ball>> for balls specifications.

[discrete]
=== Competition Cap

{++Team members can participate only twice++} in leagues played according to this
RoboCupJunior Soccer Entry ruleset. After their second participation, they need to
move on to the international RCJ Soccer leagues instead.
footnote:[Some regions will have other entry leagues that may be exempt from this rule.
Please refer to your local Organizing Committee in order to find out in which leagues
you may compete.]

Team members that participated in the international RoboCupJunior Soccer leagues before may not participate in the Entry league(s) again.

[discrete]
=== Construction and Programming have to be performed exclusively by the students

Robots must be constructed and programmed exclusively by student members of the
team. Mentors, teachers, parents or companies should not be involved in the
design, construction, assembly, programming or debugging of robots. To avoid
embarrassment and possible disqualification, it is extremely important that
teams abide by this league's regulations, especially <<regulations-construction>>
and <<regulations-programming>>, and all other competitor’s rules.

If in doubt, please consult with your Regional Representative before
registering your team.

[[gameplay]]
== GAMEPLAY

[[game-procedure-and-length-of-a-game]]
=== Game procedure and length of a game

RCJ Soccer games consist of two teams of {++one++} robot each, playing soccer against each
other. Each team has one autonomous robot. The game will consist of two
halves. The duration of each half is 10-minutes. There will be a 5-minute break
in between the halves.

The game clock will run for the duration of the halves without stopping (except
when a referee wants to consult another official). The game clock will be
run by a referee or a referee assistant (see <<referee-and-referee-assistant>>
for more information on their roles).

Teams are expected to be at the field 5 minutes before their game starts. Being
at the inspection table does not count in favor of this time limit. Teams that
are late for the start of the game can be penalized one goal *per 30 seconds*
at the referee’s discretion.

The final game score will be trimmed so that there is at most 10-goal
difference between the losing and the winning team.

[[pre-match-meeting]]
=== Pre-match meeting

At the start of the first half of the game, a referee will toss a coin.  The
team mentioned first in the draw shall call the coin. The winner of the toss
can choose either which end to kick towards, or to kick off first. The loser of
the toss chooses the other option. After the first half, teams switch sides.
The team not kicking off in the first half of the game will kick off to begin
the second half of the game.

During the pre-match meeting the referee or their assistant may check whether
the robots are capable of playing (i.e., whether they are at least able to
follow and react to the ball). If none of the robots is capable of playing, the
game will not be played and zero goals will be awarded to both teams.

[[kick-off]]
=== Kick-off

Each half of the game begins with a kick-off. All robots must be located on
their own side of the field. All robots must be halted. The ball is positioned
by a referee in the center of the field.

The team kicking off places their robot on the field first.

The team not kicking off will now place their robot on the defensive end of
the field. The robot on the team not kicking off must be at least 30 cm away
from the ball (outside of the center circle).

Robots cannot be placed inside the goal. Robots cannot be
repositioned once they have been placed, except if the referee requests to
adjust their placement to make sure that the robots are placed properly within
the field positions.

On the referee’s command (usually by whistle), all robots will be started
immediately by each captain. Any robots that are started early will be removed
by the referee from the field and deemed damaged.

Before a kick-off, *all damaged robots* are allowed to return to
the playing field immediately if they are _ready and fully functional_.

If no robots are present at a kick-off (because they are damaged <<damaged-robots>>),
the penalties are discarded and the match resumes with a <<neutral-kickoff>>.

[[neutral-kickoff]]
==== Neutral kick-off

A neutral kick-off is the same as the one described in <<kick-off>> with a
small change: all robots must be at least 30 cm away from the ball
(outside of the center circle).

[[human-interference]]
=== Human interference

Except for the kick-off, human interference from the teams (e.g. touching the
robots) during the game is not allowed unless explicitly permitted by a
referee. Violating team/team member(s) can be disqualified from the game.

The referee or a referee assistant can help robots get unstuck if the ball is
not being disputed near them and if the situation was created from normal
interaction between robots (i.e. it was not a design or programming flaw of the
robot alone). The referee or a referee assistant will pull back the robots just
enough for them to be able to move freely again.

[[ball-movement]]
=== Ball movement

A robot cannot hold a ball. Holding a ball is defined as taking full control of
the ball by removing all of degrees of freedom. Examples for ball holding
include fixing a ball to the robot’s body, surrounding a ball using the robot’s
body to prevent access by others, encircling the ball or somehow trapping the
ball with any part of the robot’s body. If a ball does not roll while a robot
is moving, it is a good indication that the ball is trapped.

The only exception to holding is the use of a rotating drum (a "dribbler") that
imparts dynamic back spin on the ball to keep the ball on its surface.

Other players must be able to access the ball.

[[scoring]]
=== Scoring

A goal is scored when the ball strikes or touches the back wall of the goal.
Goals scored either by an attacking or defending robot have the same end
result: they give one goal to the team on the opposite side.  After a goal, the
game will be restarted with a kick-off from the team who was scored against.

[[lack-of-progress]]
=== Lack of progress

Lack of progress occurs if there is no progress in the gameplay for a
reasonable period of time and the situation is not likely to change.  Typical
lack of progress situations are when the ball is stuck between robots, when
there is no change in ball and robot’s positions, or when the ball is beyond
detection or reach capability of all robots on the field.

After a visible and loud count footnote:[usually a count of three, the length of
the count could be decided by the OC before a competition as long as it’s the
same length within a sub-league], a referee will call "lack of progress" and
will move the ball to the nearest unoccupied neutral spot. If this does not
solve the lack of progress, the referee can move the ball to a different
neutral spot.


[[damaged-robots]]
=== Damaged robots

If a robot is damaged, it has to be taken off the field and must be fixed
before it can play again. Even if repaired, the robot must remain off the field
for at least one minute or until the next kick-off is due.

Some examples of a damaged robot include:

* it does not respond to the ball, or is unable to move (it lost pieces,
power, etc.).
* it continually moves into the goal or out of the playing field.
* it turns over on its own accord.

Computers and repair equipment are not permitted in the playing area during
gameplay. Usually, a team member will need to take the damaged robot to an
"approved repair table" near the playing area. A referee may permit robot
sensor calibration, computers and other tools in the playing area, only for the
5 minutes before the start of each half.

After a robot has been fixed, it will be placed on the unoccupied neutral spot
furthest from the ball, facing its own goal. A robot can only be returned to
the field if the damage has been repaired. If the referee notices that the
robot was returned to the field with the same original problem, s/he may ask
the robot to be removed and proceed with the game as if the robot had not been
returned.

*Only the referee decides whether a robot is damaged.* A robot can only be
taken off or returned with the referee’s permission.

Whenever a robot is removed from play, its motors must be turned off.


[[interruption-of-game-ref-interruption]]
=== Interruption of Game

In principle, a game will not be stopped.

A referee can stop the game if there is a situation on or around the field
which the referee wants to discuss with an official of the tournament or if the
ball malfunctions and a replacement is not readily available.

When the referee has stopped the game, all robots must be stopped and remain on
the field untouched. The referee may decide whether the game will be
continued/resumed from the situation in which the game was stopped or by a
kick-off.

[[team]]
== TEAM

[[team-regulations]]
=== Regulations

A team must have more than one member to form a RoboCupJunior team to
participate in the competition. A team member(s) and/or robot(s) cannot
be shared between teams.
The maximum number of team members is defined by
each local competition respectively, but is usually 4.

Each team member needs to carry a technical role.

Each team must have a *captain*. The captain is the person responsible
for communication with referees. The team can replace its captain with another team member during
the competition. Team is allowed to have at most two members beside the
field during game play: they will usually be the captain and an
assistant team member.

[[team-violations]]
=== Violations

Teams that do not abide by the rules are not allowed to participate.

{~~Robots are expected to be
capable of dealing with any colors above the walls (e.g. blue, yellow,
green or orange shirts) either in hardware (e.g. blocking FoV from looking up) or
in software (e.g. masking the input image).~>Any person close to the playing field is not allowed to wear any yellow
or blue clothes that can be seen by the robots (to avoid interference). A
referee can require a team member to change clothes or to be replaced by
another team member if interference is suspected.~~}

The referee can interrupt a game in progress if any kind of interference from
spectators is suspected (color clothing, IR emitters, camera flashes, mobile
phones, radios, computers, etc.).

This needs to be confirmed by an OC member if a claim is placed by the other
team. A team claiming that their robot is affected by colors has to show the
proof/evidence of the interference.

.Anyone close to the playing field is not allowed to wear orange, yellow or blue clothes
image::media/image2.png[scaledwidth=35.0%]

[[robots]]
== ROBOTS

[[number-of-robots-substitution]]
=== Number of robots / substitution

{++Each team is allowed to have only one robot for the full tournament.++}
The substitution of this robot during the competition within the team or
with other teams is forbidden.

[[robots-construction]]
=== Construction

{++Top markers (as mentioned in the international rule sets) are not required.++}

[[robots-ball]]
=== Ball Capturing Zone

The ball must not be absorbed by the robot, which is measured by a ball-capturing zone of 3 cm:

The ball-capturing zone is defined as any internal space created when a straight
edge is placed on the protruding points of a robot. This means the ball must
not enter the concave hull of a robot by more than 3 cm depth.
Furthermore, it must be possible for another robot to take possession of the
ball.

[[robots-interference]]
=== Interference

Robots are not allowed to be colored yellow or blue in order to avoid
interference. Yellow or blue colored parts used in the construction of
the robot must either be occluded by other parts from the perception by another
robot or be taped/painted with a neutral color.

Robots must not produce magnetic interference in another robot on the field.

Robots must not produce visible or infrared light that may prevent the opposing team from
playing when placed on a flat surface. Any part of a robot that produces light
that may interfere with the opposing robots vision system must be covered.

Infrared light reflecting materials must not be used on the outside of the robot.
If robots are painted, they must be painted matte. Minor parts that reflect
infrared light can be used as long as other robots are not affected. Tournament
organizers may require them to be covered if they are convinced of the danger of 
interference.

A team claiming that their robot is affected by the other team’s robot in any
way must show the proof/evidence of the interference. Any interference needs to
be confirmed by an OC member if a claim is placed by the other team.

[[robots-control]]
=== Control

The use of remote control of any kind is not allowed during the match. Robots
must be started and stopped manually by humans and be controlled autonomously.

[[communication]]
=== Communication

Robots are not allowed to use any kind of communication during game play unless
the communication between two robots is via Bluetooth class 2 or class 3
footnote:[range shorter than 20 meters] or via any other device that
communicates using the 802.15.4 protocol (e.g., ZigBee and XBee).

Teams are responsible for their communication. The availability of frequencies
cannot be guaranteed.

[[agility]]
=== Agility

Robots must be constructed and programmed in a way that their movement is not
limited to only one dimension (defined as a single axis, such as only moving in
a straight line). They must move in all directions, for example by turning.

Robots must respond to the ball in a direct forward movement towards it. For
example, it is not enough to basically just move left and right in front of
their own goal, it must also move directly towards the ball in a forward
movement. A robot must be able to seek and approach the ball
anywhere on the field.

// helper for diff- delete any time

A robot must touch the ball that is placed no further than 20 cm from any point
on its convex hull within 10 seconds. If a robot does not do so within the time
limit, it is deemed to be damaged. (See <<damaged-robots, Damaged Robots>>.)

Robots must be constructed in a way that they do not enter the goal. Robots are
allowed to use the cross-bar in order to avoid entering the goal. Any robot that
moves into the goal 3 times during a period of 20 seconds is deemed to be damaged
(see <<damaged-robots, Damaged Robots>>).

[[handle]]
=== Handle

All robots must have a stable and easily noticeable handle to hold and to lift
them. The handle must be easily accessible and allow the robot to be picked up
from at least 5 cm above the highest structure of the robot.

The dimensions of the handle may exceed the 22 cm height limitation, but the
part of the handle that exceeds this 22 cm limit cannot be used to mount
components of the robot.

[[violations]]
=== Violations

Robots that do not abide by these specifications/regulations are not allowed to play.

If violations are detected during a running game the team is disqualified for
that game.

If similar violations occur repeatedly, the team can be disqualified from the
tournament.

[[field]]
== FIELD

[[kind-of-field]]
=== Kind of field

There is only one kind of field for RoboCupJunior Soccer Entry leagues.
However, this field type can vary in size.

[[dimensions-of-the-field]]
=== Dimensions of the field

The playing field is between {++110 cm and 125 cm++} in width.

The playing field is between {++180 cm and 195 cm++} in depth.

This allows for re-using existing equipment such as older
RCJ soccer fields (122 cm by 183 cm) which is recommended, FLL fields
(114 cm in width) or for regular RCJ Soccer fields to be temporarily converted 
by some temporary wooden walls. 
Teams should contact the organizers of their tournament about the exact dimensions used within the competition.


[[field-walls]]
=== Walls

Walls are placed all around the field. The height of the walls is {++at least 10cm++}.
A height of 14 cm is recommended. The walls are painted matte black.

{++The four corners of the field are flattened in order to make it easier
for robots to retrieve the ball from a corner. The flat area is approx. 14cm in width.++}

{++There is no outer area.++}

[[goals]]
=== Goals

The field has two goals, centered on each of the shorter sides of the playing
field. The goal inner space is {++45 cm wide and 74 mm deep.++} It is box shaped
and outside the playing field (submerged into the walls). The height of the goal
is equal to the height of the walls.

{++It has a cross-bar on top (to prevent robots from entering the goal).
The size of the cross-bar is 2 +/- 1 cm in height.++}

The interior walls and the crossbar of each goal are painted, one goal in yellow,
the other goal in blue.

It is recommended that the blue be of a brighter shade so that it is
different enough from the black exterior.

[[floor]]
=== Floor

The floor consists of dark green carpet on top of a hard level surface.  All
straight lines on the field should be painted or fixed with strong adhesive tape,
and have a width of 20 mm.

[[neutral-spots]]
=== Neutral spots

There are five neutral spots defined in the field. One is in the center of the
field. The other four are adjacent to each corner, located 45 cm along the long
edge of the field, aligned with each goal post towards the middle of the field
(from the goal post). The neutral spots can be drawn with a thin black marker.
The neutral spots ought to be of circular shape measuring 1 cm in diameter.

[[center-circle]]
=== Center circle

A center circle will be drawn on the field. It is 60 cm in diameter. It is a
thin black marker line. It is there for Referees and Captains as guidance
during kick-off.

[[penalty-areas]]
=== Penalty areas

In front of each goal there is a {++30 cm wide and 75 cm++} long penalty
area.

The penalty areas are marked by {++a white line++} of 20 mm width. The
line is part of the area.

[[lighting-and-magnetic-conditions]]
=== Lighting and Magnetic Conditions

The organizers will do their best to limit the amount of external lightning and
magnetic interference. However, the robots need to be constructed in a way
which allows them to work in conditions that are not perfect (i.e. by not
relying on compass sensors or specific lightning conditions).

=== Fair Play

It is expected that the aim of all teams is to play a fair and clean game of
robot soccer. It is expected that all robots will be built with consideration
to other participants.

Robots are not allowed to cause deliberate interference with or damage to other
robots during normal game play.

Robots are not allowed to cause damage to the field or to the ball during
normal game play.

A robot that causes damage may be disqualified from a specific match at the
referee’s discretion. The OC will also be informed.

Humans are not allowed to cause deliberate interference with robots or damage
to the field or the ball.

[[behavior]]
=== Behavior

All participants are expected to behave themselves. All movement and behavior
is to be of a subdued nature within the tournament venue.

[[help]]
=== Help

Mentors (teachers, parents, chaperones, and other adult team-members including
translators) are not allowed in the student work area unless it is explicitly
but temporarily permitted by a member of the Organizing Committee. Only
participating students are allowed to be inside the work area.

*Mentors must not touch, build, repair, or program any robots.*

[[sharing]]
=== Sharing

The understanding that any technological and curricular developments should be
shared among the RoboCup and RoboCupJunior participants after the tournament
has been a part of world RoboCup competitions.

[[spirit]]
=== Spirit

It is expected that all participants, students, mentors, and parents will
respect the RoboCupJunior mission.

*_It is not whether you win or lose, but how much you learn that counts!_*

[[violations-disqualification]]
=== Violations / Disqualification

Teams that violate the code of conduct can be disqualified from the tournament.
It is also possible to disqualify only single person or single robot from
further participation in the tournament.

In less severe cases of violations of the code of conduct, a team will be given
a warning by showing it a yellow card. In severe or repeated cases of
violations of the code of conduct a team can be disqualified immediately
without a warning by showing it the red card.

[[conflict-resolution]]
== CONFLICT RESOLUTION

[[referee-and-referee-assistant]]
=== Referee and referee assistant

The referee is a person in charge of making decisions with regards to the game,
according to these rules, and may be assisted by a referee assistant.

*During gameplay, the decisions made by the referee and/or the referee
assistant are final.*

Any argument with the referee or the referee assistant can result in a warning.
If the argument continues or another argument occurs, this may result in
immediate disqualification from the game.

Only the captain has a mandate to freely speak to the referee and/or their
assistant. Shouting at a referee and/or their assistant, as well as demanding a
change in ruling can be directly penalized by a warning at the referee’s
discretion.

At the conclusion of the game, the result recorded in the scoresheet is final.
The referee will ask the captains to add written comments to the scoresheet if
they consider them necessary. These comments will be reviewed by the OC
members.

[[rule-clarification]]
=== Rule clarification

Rule clarification may be made by members of the RoboCupJunior Soccer League
Committee and Organizing Committee, if necessary even during a tournament.

[[rule-modification]]
=== Rule modification

If special circumstances, such as unforeseen problems or capabilities of a
robot occur, rules may be modified by the RoboCupJunior Soccer Committee, if
necessary even during a tournament.

[[regulatory-statutes]]
=== Regulatory statutes

Each RoboCupJunior competition may have its own regulatory statutes to define
the procedure of the tournament (for example the SuperTeam system, game modes,
the inspection of robots, interviews, schedules, etc.). Regulatory statutes
become a part of this rule.


[[regulations-construction]]
==== Construction

IMPORTANT: Robots must be constructed exclusively by the student members of a
team. Mentors, teachers, parents or companies may not be involved in the
design, construction, and assembly of robots.

For the construction of a robot, any robot kit or building block may be used as
long as the design and construction are primarily and substantially the
original work of a team. This means that commercial kits may be used but must
be substantially modified by the team. It is neither allowed to mainly follow a
construction manual, nor to just change unimportant parts.

Indications for violations are the use of commercial kits that can basically
only be assembled in one way or the fact that robots from different team(s),
build from the same commercial kit, all basically look or function the same.

Robots must be constructed in a way that they can be started by the captain
without the help of another person.

Since a contact with an opponent robot and/or dribbler that might damage some
parts of robots cannot be fully anticipated, *robots must have all its active
elements properly protected with resistant materials*. For example, electrical
circuits and pneumatic devices, such as pipelines and bottles, must be
protected from all human contact and direct contact with other robots.

IMPORTANT: All driven dribbler gears must be covered with metal or hard plastic.

When batteries are transported or moved, it is recommended that safety bags be
used. Reasonable efforts should be made to make sure that in all circumstances
robots avoid short-circuits and chemical or air leaks.

IMPORTANT: The use of swollen, tattered or otherwise dangerous battery is not
allowed.

[[regulations-programming]]
==== Programming

Robots must be programmed exclusively by student members of the team.  Mentors,
teachers, parents or companies should not be involved in the programming and
debugging of robots.

For the programming of the robots, any programming language, interface or
integrated development environment (IDE) may be used. The use of programs that
come together with a commercial kit (especially sample programs or presets) or
substantial parts of such programs are not allowed. It is not allowed to use
sample programs, not even if they are modified.

[[regulations-inspections]]
==== Inspections

Robots must be inspected and certified every day before the first game is
played. The Organizing Committee may request other inspections if necessary,
including random inspections which may happen at any time. The routine
inspections include:

* Weight restrictions for the particular sub-league (see <<dimensions>>).
* Robot dimensions (see <<dimensions>>).
* Voltage restrictions (see <<dimensions>> and <<regulations-limitations>>).
* Kicker strength limits, if the robot has a kicker (see<<kicker-power-measuring>>).

Proof must be provided by each team that its robots comply with these
regulations, for example, by a detailed documentation or logbook. Teams may be
interviewed about their robots and the development process at any time during a
tournament.


[appendix]
[[technical-specification-for-pulsed-soccer-ball]]
== Technical Specification for pulsed Soccer Ball

[[pulsed-preamble]]
=== Preamble

Answering to the request for a soccer ball for RCJ tournaments that would be
more robust to interfering lights, less energy consuming and mechanically more
resistant, the RCJ Soccer League Committee defined the following technical
specifications with the special collaboration from EK Japan and HiTechnic.

Producers of these balls must apply for a certification process upon which they
can exhibit the RCJ-compliant label and their balls used in RCJ tournaments.

Balls with these specifications can be detected using specific sensors from
HiTechnic (IRSeeker - information on distance and angle) but also common IR
remote control receivers (TSOP1140, TSOP31140, GP1UX511QS, etc.
- on-off detection with a possible gross indication of distance).

[[pulsed-specifications]]
=== Specifications

[[ir-light]]
==== IR light

The ball emits infra-red (IR) light of wavelengths in the range 920nm - 960nm,
pulsed at a square-wave carrier frequency of 40 KHz. The ball should have
enough ultra-bright, wide-angle LEDs to minimize unevenness of the IR output.

[[pulsed-diameter]]
==== Diameter

The diameter of the ball is required to be 74mm. A well-balanced ball shall be
used.

[[pulsed-drop-test]]
==== Drop Test

The ball must be able to resist normal game play. As an indication of its
durability, it should be able to survive, undamaged, a free-fall from 1.5
meters onto a hardwood table or floor.

[[pulsed-modulation]]
==== Modulation

The 40 KHz carrier output of the ball shall be modulated with a trapezoidal
(stepped) waveform of frequency 1.2 kHz. Each 833-microsecond cycle of the
modulation waveform shall comprise 8 carrier pulses at full intensity, followed
(in turn) by 4 carrier pulses at 1/4 of full intensity, four pulses at 1/16 of
full intensity and four pulses at 1/64 of full intensity, followed by a space
(i.e. zero intensity) of about 346 microseconds. The peak current level in the
LEDs shall be within the range 45-55mA. The radiant intensity shall be more
than 20mW/sr per LED.

[[pulsed-battery-life]]
==== Battery Life

If the ball has an embedded rechargeable battery, when new and fully charged it
should last for more than 3 hours of continuous use before the brightness of
the LEDs drops to 90% of the initial value. If the ball uses replaceable
batteries, a set of new high-quality alkaline batteries should last for more
than 8 hours of continuous use before the brightness of the LEDs drops to 90%
of the initial value.

[[pulsed-coloration]]
==== Coloration

The ball must not have any marks or discoloration that can be confused with
goals, or the field itself.

[[official-suppliers-for-pulsed-balls]]
=== Official suppliers for pulsed balls

Currently, there is one ball that has been approved by the RoboCupJunior
Soccer League Committee:

- RoboSoccer ball operating in MODE A (pulsed) made by EK Japan/Elekit (https://elekit.co.jp)

Note that this ball was previously called RCJ-05.  While you may not be able to
find a ball with this name anymore, any IR ball produced by EK Japan/Elekit is
considered to be approved by the Soccer League Committee.

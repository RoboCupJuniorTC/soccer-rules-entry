# RoboCupJunior Soccer rules

Welcome to the [RoboCupJunior Soccer](https://junior.robocup.org/) rules
repository for the 2020 season.

For this season the RoboCupJunior Soccer Technical Committee (TC) would like to
invite the RoboCupJunior Soccer community to suggest any changes that would be
worth making to the rules. Note that the Technical Committee will in the end
approve or disapprove any suggested changes for the 2020 rules, but every
suggested change (that is found to be reasonable by the TC) will be looked at,
examined and considered.

## What changes are you looking for?

Contrary to previous years, this year we are looking for a significant change
which will help ensure the Soccer challenge stays challenging while not making
it difficult for newcomers to try it out.

Changes that would improve formatting of the rules or their clarity are most
definitely welcome.

We accept proposals until the **1st of June, 2019**.

## How do I suggest a change?

Please edit the [`rules.adoc`](https://github.com/RoboCupJuniorTC/soccer-rules/edit/master/rules.adoc)
file. The easiest way of doing that seems to be following the
[GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)
on how to edit files in another user's repository.

In the end that should
result in a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

When suggesting a change, please follow the following rules:

1. Small Pull Requests are better than big ones.
2. Please only include one 'change type' (i.e. grammar/structure/gameplay ...)
   in one Pull Request
3. Please make sure to fill in the [Pull Request template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

The rules are written in a human readable formatting langue called
[AsciiDoc](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/), which should
make them quite readable and easy to edit, so please feel free to do so!

## That's way too complicated!

We do realize it may look like that. If you do not feel comfortable with
suggesting a change using the process above, feel free to create a new thread
on [the RCJ Soccer forum](https://junior.forum.robocup.org/c/robocupjunior-soccer).
Please make sure the title contains the term **Rule Change Suggestion** and
that your submission contains answers to the following sections:

- **Describe your suggestion in one or two sentences**
- **Explain why do you think it should be in the rules**
- **List the relevant section(s) of previous rules (if applicable)**


We can discuss your suggestion there, and if it makes sense someone will
certainly put it into the actual `rules.adoc` document.
